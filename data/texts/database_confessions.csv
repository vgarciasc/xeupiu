Ayako;Ayako;Oh, sorry. Did you wait long?\nSorry for calling you here...;0:09,550;1.0
Ayako;<PLAYER_NAME>;It's fine. What's up?;0:15,780;1.0
Ayako;Ayako;Um...;0:19,970;0.5
Ayako;Ayako;I wanted to ask you something...;0:23,470;1.0
Ayako;Ayako;...Do you dislike girls who are rough around the edges?;0:26,470;1.0
Ayako;<PLAYER_NAME>;No, I like them... Why?;0:29,260;0.8
Ayako;Ayako;Ｏｈ ｗａｉｔ, just a moment...;0:34,800;1.0
Ayako;Ayako;That's not the real reason I called you.;0:37,720;1.0
Ayako;Ayako;There's something I really want to tell you...;0:40,050;1.0
Ayako;Ayako;Ah...;0:44,660;1.0
Ayako;Ayako;I know I may not have seemed that way,\nsince I talk to everyone easily...;0:47,780;1.0
Ayako;Ayako;...but when I talk with you, I feel the most relaxed.;0:55,100;1.0
Ayako;Ayako;I only realized this recently.;1:00,300;1.0
Ayako;Ayako;The thought of graduating and not being able to see you anymore...;1:04,930;1.0
Ayako;Ayako;It made me really sad, and I didn't know what to do...;1:11,690;1.0
Ayako;Ayako;I'm a pretty easy-going person, but I've thought seriously\nabout this, and I've made up my mind.;1:20,950;1.0
Ayako;Ayako;It's really embarrassing for a girl to say this,\nbut I want you to hear my true feelings...;1:29,650;1.0
Ayako;Ayako;Just listen to them, that is enough.;1:35,700;1.0
Ayako;<PLAYER_NAME>;..........;1:42,290;1.0

Ayako;Ayako;Oh my goodness, I can't believe it! Really?;2:07,590;1.0
Ayako;<PLAYER_NAME>;I wouldn't joke at a time like this.;2:13,250;1.3

Yuko;<PLAYER_NAME>;A-Asahina-san...;0:00,700;0.8
Yuko;Yuko;I don't know why I called you out here...;0:04,660;1.0
Yuko;Yuko;But there's something I want to say before graduation...\nHow can I say it?;0:09,850;1.0
Yuko;<PLAYER_NAME>;Something you want to say...?;0:15,970;0.8
Yuko;Yuko;I used to love going to all the trendy places\nand follow fads, but...;0:20,630;1.0
Yuko;Yuko;I don't know how to explain it.\nLately, I've gotten tired of it.;0:26,790;1.0
Yuko;Yuko;I feel like, if I'm with someone I like,\nI'll have fun no matter where we go!;0:32,980;1.0
Yuko;Yuko;Like right now, being with you feels that way.;0:38,640;1.0
Yuko;<PLAYER_NAME>;So you've gotten tired of it, huh?;0:40,670;0.8
Yuko;Yuko;You're such an idiot sometimes.\nI'm saying that being with you is fun for me!;0:44,840;1.0
Yuko;<PLAYER_NAME>;W-What does that mean...?;0:51,990;0.8
Yuko;Yuko;It's embarrassing to say, but...;0:55,600;1.0
Yuko;Yuko;I think... I've fallen for you.;0:59,810;1.0
Yuko;Yuko;As long as I have you, I don't need anything else!\nI don't care about trends anymore.;1:03,720;1.0
Yuko;Yuko;So, please, go out with me.;1:12,110;1.0
Yuko;<PLAYER_NAME>;Actually, I... I've liked you too, Asahina-san...;1:14,850;0.8
Yuko;Yuko;That's amazing, I'm so happy!;1:20,150;1.0
Yuko;Yuko;But still, isn't it more fun to go somewhere,\nrather than just being together all the time?;1:22,180;1.0
Yuko;<PLAYER_NAME>;Y-Yeah, you're right. ;1:27,650;0.8
Yuko;Yuko;Then, once we graduate, let's go on a trip somewhere!;1:30,820;1.0
Yuko;<PLAYER_NAME>;Sure, sounds good.;1:33,830;0.8
Yuko;Yuko;Then let's head to the travel agency right now. Come on, hurry, hurry!;1:36,950;1.0
Yuko;<PLAYER_NAME>;(Well, she hasn’t changed at all... but I guess that's okay.);1:42,640;0.8
Nozomi;<PLAYER_NAME>;K-Kiyokawa-san...;0:01,000;0.8
Nozomi;Nozomi;Sorry for calling you out here.;0:04,590;1.0
Nozomi;<PLAYER_NAME>;It's fine, really. What's wrong?;0:08,790;1.0
Nozomi;Nozomi;Since we're graduating today, there’s something I really need to tell you.\nJust listening is enough...;0:13,990;1.0
Nozomi;<PLAYER_NAME>;Yeah... I'll listen.;0:21,190;1.0
Nozomi;Nozomi;Up until now, I've only focused on swimming,\nI never had time for love or romance...;0:24,970;1.0
Nozomi;Nozomi;...and the guys around me were all so weak,\nnone of them ever caught my interest.;0:31,990;1.0
Nozomi;Nozomi;So I never paid any attention to that stuff.;0:37,480;1.0
Nozomi;Nozomi;But lately, something changed, and I don't know when.;0:41,080;1.0
Nozomi;Nozomi;I started to think more and more about you...;0:45,380;1.0
Nozomi;Nozomi;I couldn't even focus on my training anymore.;0:49,340;1.0
Nozomi;Nozomi;Lately, I can’t even sleep at night...;0:52,240;1.0
Nozomi;Nozomi;...and my heart has been restless.;0:56,230;1.0
Nozomi;Nozomi;People have always told me that I look like a boy,\nbut that never bothered me.;0:59,310;1.0
Nozomi;Nozomi;But with you... I don't want you to see me that way.;1:07,080;1.0
Nozomi;Nozomi;That’s why I’ve tried not to speak roughly in front of you,\nand I’ve even watched how I act.;1:11,120;1.0
Nozomi;Nozomi;If none of that’s enough, then I’ll give up swimming.;1:20,170;1.0
Nozomi;Nozomi;I’ll grow my hair out as long as you want it!;1:24,380;1.0
Nozomi;Nozomi;S-Sorry...  know I’m saying all these selfish things...;1:28,420;1.0
Nozomi;Nozomi;But it’s okay if you reject me.;1:32,030;1.0
Nozomi;Nozomi;I just don’t want to graduate with these feelings bottled up. ;1:37,030;1.0
Nozomi;Nozomi;I wanted you to hear how I feel...;1:42,010;1.0
Nozomi;<PLAYER_NAME>;Okay...;1:44,350;1.0
Nozomi;Nozomi;I love you.;1:47,950;1.0
Nozomi;Nozomi;So much I can't sleep at night.;1:49,360;1.0
Nozomi;<PLAYER_NAME>;............;1:51,370;1.0
Nozomi;Nozomi;I-I see, of course!!;1:54,250;1.0
Nozomi;Nozomi;Of course, someone like me isn’t good enough!;1:56,990;1.0
Nozomi;Nozomi;But at least I feel relieved having said it.\nThank you for listening.;2:01,450;1.0
Nozomi;<PLAYER_NAME>;K-Kiyokawa-san. Wait.;2:07,960;1.0
Nozomi;Nozomi;Don’t stop me. If you stop me, I’ll start hoping.;2:12,460;1.0
Nozomi;Nozomi;And if you say something just to comfort me,\nI’ll feel miserable...;2:17,100;1.0
Nozomi;<PLAYER_NAME>;Kiyokawa-san. I love you too.;2:21,050;1.0
Nozomi;Nozomi;W-what did you just say...?;2:25,940;1.0
Nozomi;<PLAYER_NAME>;I said, I love you, Kiyokawa-san.;2:30,080;1.0
Nozomi;Nozomi;R-Really? Even someone like me,\nwho's only good at swimming...?;2:37,910;1.0
Nozomi;<PLAYER_NAME>;Of course.;2:45,080;1.0
Nozomi;Nozomi;I-I can't... Now I can't stop crying... ;2:48,970;1.0
Nozomi;Nozomi;Please... ;2:56,290;1.0
Nozomi;Nozomi;Let me cry in your arms.;2:58,310;1.0
Nozomi;<PLAYER_NAME>;It's okay.;3:01,430;1.0
Nozomi;Nozomi;I’m so happy. This is the best feeling ever...;3:04,080;1.0
Yuina;<PLAYER_NAME>;H-Himoo-san...;0:00,600;1.0
Yuina;Yuina;You kept me waiting.;0:03,960;1.0
Yuina;Yuina;N-no... sorry... for calling you out to a place like this.;0:06,180;1.0
Yuina;<PLAYER_NAME>;What's wrong, Himoo-san? You're acting strange...;0:11,840;1.0
Yuina;Yuina;It's f-fine. I've decided to change, starting today.;0:18,700;1.0
Yuina;<PLAYER_NAME>;Huh? Change?;0:23,850;1.0
Yuina;Yuina;Yes, change.;0:27,050;1.0
Yuina;Yuina;Until now, I've been looking down on others because of my own talent.;0:30,870;1.0
Yuina;Yuina;I've been a girl that anyone would find annoying.;0:37,840;1.0
Yuina;Yuina;I used to mock girls who cared about things like love and romance.;0:42,710;1.0
Yuina;Yuina;But at some point...;0:48,950;1.0
Yuina;Yuina;I started to feel something new, stirring inside me...;0:50,810;1.0
Yuina;Yuina;Then, I realized I had fallen for you.;0:57,840;1.0
Yuina;Yuina;But I’m a woman who sold her soul to the demon of science.;1:02,780;1.0
Yuina;Yuina;I wanted to suppress it.;1:09,160;1.0
Yuina;Yuina;I experimented with that.;1:12,030;1.0
Yuina;Yuina;But graduation kept coming...;1:15,070;1.0
Yuina;Yuina;And those feelings grew stronger,\nuntil I couldn't hold them back anymore.;1:20,950;1.0
Yuina;Yuina;That’s why I challenged you to a fight...;1:26,910;1.0
Yuina;Yuina;Because I wanted to completely deny those emotions.;1:32,140;1.0
Yuina;Yuina;The result... well, I don’t have to say it... ;1:35,860;1.0
Yuina;Yuina;I lost to you in every possible way.;1:40,640;1.0
Yuina;Yuina;I don’t want to even think about you hating me anymore...;1:46,800;1.0
Yuina;Yuina;I’m abandoning my ambitions of world domination!;1:52,030;1.0
Yuina;Yuina;Because now, my only ambition is for you to like me...;1:58,030;1.0
Yuina;<PLAYER_NAME>;To tell you the truth... I also like you, Himoo-san...;2:00,960;1.0
Yuina;Yuina;R-Really?;2:08,940;1.0
Yuina;Yuina;Then, my ambition has been fulfilled!;2:10,990;1.0
Yuina;Yuina;I'm so happy...;2:15,770;1.0
Yuina;Yuina;Even if I had taken over the world,\nI don’t think I could have been this happy...;2:18,140;1.0
Yuina;<PLAYER_NAME>;I’m happy, too!;2:25,860;1.0
Yuina;Yuina;I'll try harder and harder... to become a girl you like even more.;2:29,160;1.0
Shiori;<PLAYER_NAME>;Sh-Shiori-san?;0:00,700;1.0
Shiori;Shiori;I'm sorry to call you out to a place like this.;0:04,040;1.0
Shiori;Shiori;There’s something I really need to tell you today...;0:09,150;1.0
Shiori;<PLAYER_NAME>;What's wrong, Shiori?;0:11,940;1.0
Shiori;Shiori;I’ve... never dated a boy before... ;0:16,660;1.0
Shiori;Shiori;But it’s not because I wasn’t interested.;0:22,870;1.0
Shiori;Shiori;I wanted to try dating, too. I’ve even gotten several love letters before!;0:27,630;1.0
Shiori;Shiori;But I just couldn’t bring myself to date anyone...;0:35,060;1.0
Shiori;<PLAYER_NAME>;W-Why not?;0:38,660;1.0
Shiori;Shiori;Because of you...;0:41,770;1.0
Shiori;Shiori;Because you were always by my side...;0:43,760;1.0
Shiori;Shiori;Until now, I thought of you as just a childhood friend...;0:46,790;1.0
Shiori;Shiori;No, maybe I convinced myself of that...;0:53,000;1.0
Shiori;Shiori;Because I was scared of you realizing how I truly felt.;0:58,790;1.0
Shiori;Shiori;But now that we’re graduating...\nNow that we might go our separate ways...;1:02,050;1.0
Shiori;Shiori;I’ve finally come to realize these feelings. ;1:07,830;1.0
Shiori;Shiori;It's embarrassing to say... and I want to run away...;1:12,190;1.0
Shiori;Shiori;...but I don't want us to just be childhood friends anymore.;1:14,890;1.0
Shiori;Shiori;I want you to see me as a girl, to see only me.;1:19,170;1.0
Shiori;Shiori;So I’m gathering my courage to tell you...;1:24,100;1.0
Shiori;Shiori;I love you.;1:28,050;1.0
Shiori;Shiori;More than anyone else in the entire world, I love you...;1:30,100;1.0
Shiori;<PLAYER_NAME>;To tell the truth...\nI’ve also loved you, Shiori...;1:34,110;1.0
Shiori;Shiori;H-huh?;1:39,850;1.0
Shiori;Shiori;I’m so happy, but... I can’t stop crying!;1:43,900;1.0
Shiori;Shiori;I can really believe this, right? You really mean it?;1:48,780;1.0
Shiori;<PLAYER_NAME>;Of course I do. I love you, Shiori.;1:52,120;1.0
Shiori;Shiori;I'm happy... I'm so happy...;1:58,120;1.0
Shiori;Shiori;Please, never let me go...;2:02,070;1.0
Mira;<PLAYER_NAME>;Oh, Kagami-san.;0:00,000;1.25
Mira;Mira;I'm sorry for calling you out to a place like this.;0:03,480;1
Mira;<PLAYER_NAME>;W-Wait, did Kagami-san just apologize...?;0:07,220;1
Mira;Mira;Oh, there's no need to be so surprised.;0:13,160;1
Mira;Mira;But, please, listen to what I have to say.;0:17,010;1
Mira;<PLAYER_NAME>;........;0:21,140;1
Mira;Mira;I moved to this town back when I was in middle school.;0:24,220;1
Mira;Mira;In my last town... I got dumped by boys so many times.;0:29,340;1
Mira;Mira;So, when I came here, I thought...;0:35,450;1
Mira;Mira;"I’ll reinvent myself. I’ll make boys want me,\nand I'll be the one doing the dumping.";0:41,190;1
Mira;Mira;With a lot of effort, I became that girl.;0:46,290;1
Mira;Mira;And then, I took on this high and mighty attitude,\nand sought my revenge.;0:53,340;1
Mira;<PLAYER_NAME>;S-So that’s how it was...;0:59,010;1
Mira;Mira;At first, it was fun... I was happy to be admired by boys.;1:03,270;1
Mira;Mira;But it didn’t satisfy my heart.;1:10,510;1
Mira;Mira;Of course it didn’t. Living a lie could never fulfill me.;1:16,450;1
Mira;Mira;If I hadn’t met you, I might never have realized this...;1:24,210;1
Mira;Mira;Meeting you made me think about a lot of stuff.;1:28,580;1
Mira;Mira;If it was with you, I could finally abandon this charade!;1:32,230;1
Mira;Mira;Except... I didn’t have the courage to give up who I had become.;1:36,110;1
Mira;Mira;I didn’t want to go back to my old self...;1:42,050;1
Mira;Mira;But now I finally found this courage!;1:45,550;1
Mira;Mira;I can’t stand the thought of graduating\nwhile you still think of me as this kind of girl!;1:50,290;1
Mira;Mira;You're different from the others...;1:55,420;1
Mira;Mira;I just want you by my side. Only you can heal the scars in my heart.;2:02,330;1
Mira;Mira;I love you. Stay with me forever... Please...;2:08,180;1
Mira;<PLAYER_NAME>;So that’s how it is...;2:13,590;1
Mira;Mira;Still, I'm probably not good enough, am I?;2:17,450;1
Mira;<PLAYER_NAME>;No, not at all! I'm here for you.;2:20,470;1.25
Mira;Mira;Really? That makes me so happy!\nI can finally be my true self.;2:24,470;1
Mira;<PLAYER_NAME>;But the other guys might hate me, you know?;2:28,980;1
Mira;Mira;It’s okay. You’re the one I chose.;2:35,460;1
Mira;Mira;No one else would dare complain.;2:40,100;1
Mira;<PLAYER_NAME>;Yeah, right. We'll see about that...;2:42,450;1
Rei;<PLAYER_NAME>;Eh? Who are you?;0:00,000;1
Rei;<PLAYER_NAME>;Have we met somewhere before?;0:03,200;1
Rei;Rei;I... I’m Ijuuin.;0:08,380;1
Rei;<PLAYER_NAME>;Ijuuin? I don’t remember him having a sister.;0:12,250;1.5
Rei;Rei;No... I’m Ijuuin Rei.;0:17,130;1
Rei;<PLAYER_NAME>;Eh?;0:20,210;0.5
Rei;Rei;I’m sorry. All this time,\nI’ve been pretending to be a boy... lying to you.;0:22,190;1
Rei;<PLAYER_NAME>;That’s... quite a lie.;0:29,270;1
Rei;Rei;In the Ijuuin family, girls are required to live as boys\noutside the house until they graduate.;0:32,350;1
Rei;<PLAYER_NAME>;Like in a manga...;0:40,530;1.2
Rei;Rei;But I... Even though there was only one day left,\nI couldn’t take it anymore.;0:43,540;1
Rei;Rei;I’m sorry for calling you out like this.;0:51,150;1
Rei;<PLAYER_NAME>;I-It’s fine. Really...;0:54,510;1
Rei;Rei;I’m sorry for always being so harsh with you...;0:59,050;1
Rei;Rei;But the truth is, I said all those things\nbecause I wanted you to hate me.;1:03,000;1
Rei;Rei;I thought that if you hated me, I could forget about you...;1:10,310;1
Rei;Rei;But no matter how awful I was, you kept calling me...;1:15,880;1
Rei;Rei;Even after I said such terrible things,\nyou kept calling me, over and over.;1:21,570;1
Rei;Rei;And every time, I cried on the other end of the line,\nbecause I was so happy!;1:27,290;1
Rei;Rei;And when I was kidnapped...\nyou even went to that abandoned factory to save me.;1:32,340;1
Rei;Rei;I couldn’t believe someone would worry about me like that.;1:39,070;1
Rei;Rei;I’ve always tried to live strong, but...;1:44,280;1
Rei;Rei;I’m just a normal girl.;1:47,500;1
Rei;Rei;I wanted to hang out with everyone, chat, and go out like normal.;1:51,080;1
Rei;Rei;Even on Valentine’s Day, I wanted to...;1:57,280;1
Rei;Rei;Starting tomorrow, I’ll finally be able to live like that.\nBut right now, I want you to see the real me.;2:01,470;1
Rei;Rei;I don’t care about the Ijuuin family anymore.;2:08,540;1
Rei;Rei;So... I love you.;2:12,190;1
Rei;Rei;I’m sorry for lying to you all this time.;2:16,150;1
Rei;Rei;But... will you go out with me?;2:19,500;1
Rei;<PLAYER_NAME>;Ijuuin... No, Ijuuin-san...;2:23,190;1
Rei;Rei;I know this might be a bother, but...\nPlease tell me how you feel.;2:28,490;1
Rei;Rei;If I can hear it, maybe I can give up...;2:33,440;1
Rei;<PLAYER_NAME>;There’s no way I could reject someone who likes me so much.;2:36,000;1
Rei;Rei;R-Really...?;2:43,340;1
Rei;<PLAYER_NAME>;Of course. The answer is yes.;2:46,080;1
Rei;Rei;I... I don’t even know what to say...;2:50,280;1
Rei;Rei;I finally feel like I’ve become a normal girl...;2:56,150;1
Rei;<PLAYER_NAME>;Can I ask you one thing, though?;2:58,340;1
Rei;Rei;Hm?;3:03,340;1
Rei;<PLAYER_NAME>;That time when Takayoshi collapsed...;3:04,560;1
Rei;Rei;I-I'm sorry... When Takayoshi-kun realized that I was a girl,\nI had to alter his memory.;3:10,270;1
Rei;<PLAYER_NAME>;I thought so...;3:20,110;1
Rei;Rei;Do you... despise me for it?;3:25,370;1
Rei;<PLAYER_NAME>;No... I understand why you did it...;3:28,170;1
Rei;Rei;Thank you... You’re so kind... ;3:34,050;1
Rei;Rei;I’m so glad I fell in love with you!;3:38,300;1
Miharu;<PLAYER_NAME>;Ah, you're...;0:00,000;1
Miharu;Miharu;I’m sorry for everything up until now.;0:03,310;1
Miharu;Miharu;My name is Miharu Tatebayashi.;0:06,330;1
Miharu;Miharu;I called you out here because...;0:11,170;1
Miharu;Miharu;...there’s something I absolutely have to tell you!;0:14,320;1
Miharu;<PLAYER_NAME>;Something you have to tell me?;0:18,160;1
Miharu;Miharu;All those times I bumped into you...\nWell, it wasn’t by coincidence.;0:22,400;1
Miharu;<PLAYER_NAME>;Yeah, I figured out that much.;0:27,560;1
Miharu;Miharu;I-I see...!;0:33,910;1
Miharu;Miharu;The truth is, I fell in love with you at first sight.\nI've always been watching you!;0:36,190;1
Miharu;Miharu;So I did those things...\nbecause I wanted you to at least remember my face.;0:43,260;1
Miharu;Miharu;I’m so sorry.;0:49,410;1
Miharu;<PLAYER_NAME>;I-I see... So that's what happened...;0:50,600;1
Miharu;Miharu;Umm... I know it’s selfish after what I did, but...;0:56,260;1
Miharu;Miharu;I still believe in love at first sight.\nPlease go out with me!;1:03,000;1
Miharu;<PLAYER_NAME>;Actually, I’ve also been thinking about you, Tatebayashi-san.;1:07,410;1
Miharu;Miharu;So... is that an OK!?;1:14,530;1
Miharu;Miharu;I’m so happy!!!;1:17,360;1
Miharu;Miharu;Let’s get to know each other from now on!;1:20,260;1

Mio;Mio;I’ve always been weak physically,\nso I didn’t have many friends.;0:23,320;1
Mio;Mio;My only real hobby has been reading books.;0:30,420;1
Mio;Mio;And every time I read, I found myself\nadmiring the romances in those stories...;0:35,120;1
Mio;Mio;...but also feeling a little jealous.;0:41,490;1
Mio;Mio;It made me ashamed of myself,\ntoo timid to share my real feelings.;0:47,050;1
Mio;Mio;I’ve always hated that about me...;0:52,100;1
Mio;Mio;But starting today, I want to change who I’ve been.;0:54,540;1
Mio;<PLAYER_NAME>;W-Why today?;1:02,180;1.5

Mio;Mio;But I don't want my time in high school,\nmy time with you, to be just another memory!;1:12,580;1
Mio;Mio;I don't want to let it be just another one of my fantasies...;1:22,070;1

Mio;Mio;*giggles*;2:14,480;1

Yumi;Yumi;I’ve cried so many times... why couldn’t I have been born\nwhen my big brother was born instead...?;0:27,450;1
Yumi;Yumi;Yumi knows that compared to the girls in your grade,\nYumi seems childish and selfish.;0:35,400;1
Yumi;Yumi;But if you don’t like that I’m childish,\nI’ll work hard to be more mature!;0:44,360;1
Yumi;Yumi;I’ll stop being selfish too!;0:50,060;1
Yumi;Yumi;So please...;0:53,150;1
